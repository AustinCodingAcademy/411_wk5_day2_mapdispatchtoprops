----- Redux actions & action creators ----
1. An action is an object
2. Two properties: 
    * type 
        - all caps
        - underscore
        - tells reducter what to run
    * value
        - what value you want to change
        - also called payload
3. Action creator is a function that takes in a value and returns the action object

    export const addCar = (newCar) => {
        return {
            type: 'ADD_CAR',
            value: newCar
        }
    }

4. Possible actions: add, remove, update, set user, etc.
5. When removing, likely will take in an index
----- Reducers ------
6. Could use if/ else, but demonstrated as switch 
7. Set up default value/ parameter for state

    const = cars = (state = []) => state

8. Take in second parameter, an action  

    const = cars = (state = [], action) =>

    * in our case, this action is an action creator
9. Switch statement, looks for action.type
    * action.type for addCar() is ADD_CAR

    switch(action.type) {

    }

10. First case returns spread and action.value.
    *Takes in existing state
    *takes everything out and puts it in a new array
    *and adds our new action and value

    switch(action.type) {
        case 'ADD_CAR':
            return [...state, action.value]
    }

11. Second case, REMOVE_CAR
    *makes a copy to mutate
    *bc we never want to mutate the original state

    case 'REMOVE_CAR':
        const newState = [...state]

12. Remove current value and splice in new value

        newState.splice(action.value, 1)
        return newState

        *this would normally be a find funciton to find by index and return new
        * but in this example, we're only dealing with one element in the array

13. Always have default 

    default:
        return state

-------mapDispatchToProps-------------
14. mapDispatchToProps is going to allow us access to the function(s)/ methods to manipulate state
    *from the Reducers

15. Bring in Home component

    import Home from '../components/Home'

16. Bring in the two actions (which are functions) we created

    import { addCar, removeCar } from './actions'

17. Pass the dispate functin a a properties

    const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {

    }

18. Return an object with a key, 
    * takes in car, which is the value from the addCar function (see step 3)
    * calls the addCarfunction with that value, car, passed in
    * gets dispatched by the dispatch function

    const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
        return (
            addCar: (car) => dispatch(addCar(car))
        )
    }

19. Also returns removeCar, which does similar

            removeCar: (index) => dispatch(removeCar(index))

20. Export matchDispatchToProps as second value in connect function

    export dfault connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Home)

1. Kinda the inverse of mapStateToProps

----addCar action--------
2. Actions are functions that return an object 
    export const addCar = (car) => {
        return {
            type: "ADD_CAR",
            value: car
        }
    }
3. Another way to write it:
    * without return, change curly braces to parentheses
    * implicit
    * only when you're doing one action
    * e.g., can't use with a console log
export const addCar = (car) => (
     {
        type: "ADD_CAR",
       
        value: car
    }
)
4. Reducers destrutured parameter
const cars = (state = [], {type, value}) => {
    switch(type) {
        case "ADD_CAR" : 
            return [value, ...state]
        
        case "REMOVE_CAR" :
            let newState = [...state]
            newState.splice(action.value, 1)
            return newState
        default :
            return state
    }
}
5. After importing the container to Dashboard, I'm very confused.
    *I think this is because the video is different from this project
    * and the example from class was changed to functional programming from class-based
    * try watching class video from Tue 12/7 from about min 45 (apprx 7:30pm)
